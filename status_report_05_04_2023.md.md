## Data
After the meeting with Franck Jeannin, I decided to go for a camera to film a beehive and create my own dataset out of it.
I started the hardware part of the project camera wise to be able to film the beehive.
I searched for a camera that would fit four requirements :
- It should be able to film in High resolution since bees are small
- It should be able to film in low light 
- It should be small to not hinder the bees or be taken as target by them
- It should have a good battery life and be waterproof to be able to film for a long time outside
  
first choice :
[IMX179](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005005307106315.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.7.a59e5464ff8x2p&algo_pvid=13c05464-2b51-471b-8333-d94e6557454c&algo_exp_id=13c05464-2b51-471b-8333-d94e6557454c-3&pdp_npi=3%40dis%21EUR%2154.19%2135.22%21%21%21%21%21%402102188b16806476668711522d06fe%2112000032570040379%21sea%21FR%213335011108&curPageLogUid=FDbjN1sgP0pu)

Small, waterproof, , good resolution, good in low light and external batteries. Needs a few weeks/months to arrive from China.

second choice :
[camera for raspberry](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005003428902905.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.75.a59e5464ff8x2p&algo_pvid=13c05464-2b51-471b-8333-d94e6557454c&algo_exp_id=13c05464-2b51-471b-8333-d94e6557454c-37&pdp_npi=3%40dis%21EUR%2111.41%2111.41%21%21%21%21%21%402102188b16806476668711522d06fe%2112000025742610117%21sea%21FR%213335011108&curPageLogUid=83QWqKa62QYu)

Using the hardware I currently have [raspberry pi 4] it would be easy to implement and actually be 100% compatible with the current project. The only problem is that the resolution is not as good as the first choice and the camera is not waterproof.

I am still considering. I will probably go for the second choice since it is more compatible with the current project and I can always buy a better camera later on.

### Model Progress
The best model is still the same.

### Real-time AI Library
I am still evaluating YOLO, I found it to be quite difficult to implement and I am not sure if it is the best solution for this project.
